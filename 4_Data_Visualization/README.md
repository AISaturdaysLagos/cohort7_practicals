# Industrial Strength Visualization: Data Storytelling Using Python Visualization Libraries

Data visualization provides a pictorial representation of your data. It provides more information on what you think your data contains. 

In real-life data, visualization is an important process to data analysis, which involves storytelling and recommendations. 

In this practical, we will be looking at real-world data on `2020 World Population by Countries`, to gather as much information and write out our findings/insights.

The visualization tools used are [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)


## Setup:
- If you haven't already, clone this repo. 
- We use virtual environments in ti. If you already have a virtual environment created for a previous practical, you can simply activate the environment and install pandas using
```
pip install matplotlib seaborn
```
Otherwise, create a new virtual environment then 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Go through the notebook to try your hands on the codes. ðŸ”¨ðŸ”¨
- While doing that, you may realise that there are some details that weren't explored and that'll be awesome. So get at them! ðŸ”¨ðŸ”¨

## Data
The dataset used in this practice was sourced [here](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/).
It contains details of each country/dependent territory's world population as of 2020, their yearly growth rate, and other population-related information.
