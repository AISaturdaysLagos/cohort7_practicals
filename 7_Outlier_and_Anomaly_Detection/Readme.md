### Outlier and Anomaly Detection
This practical introduces you to anomaly detection using PyOD. 

### Installation and setup
Regardless of your virtual environment you need to install the PyOD using the codes below. 
If you already have a virtual environment created for a previous practical, simply activate the environment and install

```
pip install pyod

pip install --upgrade pyod 

```

### Data
Apart from the generated data, the data in this tutorial is from the BigMart Sales competition on Kaggle. The dataset shows BigMart 2013 sales data. 
You can find the dataset and feature description [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hiralmshah/bigmart-sales-prediction/data)

### Project Ideas
- Explore outlier detection for univariate data
- Check Sea 'Turtle Rescue: Error Detection Challenge' on Zindi. It's a closed competition so remenber to check show closed competition when searching for it. Alternatively use this [link](https://zindi.africa/competitions/sea-turtle-rescue-error-detection-challenge)
