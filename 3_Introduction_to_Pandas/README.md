# `Introduction to Pandas`

## `Objective`

In this project, we explore some of the methods Pandas makes available to analyze, explore and visualize data.

## `Project Setup and Installation`
You can choose to run this notebook in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BAJvL0KLAMw976RKi9qZ7ak8-9sv7Vft?usp=sharing). If you do so, be sure to `duplicate` the notebook so that you have a copy you can edit and run.

Alternatively, you can work in a virtual environment. If you already have a virtual environment created for a previous practical, you can simply activate the environment and install pandas using
```
pip install pandas==1.3.3
```
Otherwise, create a new virtual environment then 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## `Data`
Apart from made up datasets, this practical uses the `Loan Default Prediction` dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kmldas/loan-default-prediction). The data is fictional but has been created from actual data from a financial institution.


## `Task`

## `Project Ideas`
* Register for the ongoing [Zindi User Behaviour Birthday Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/zindi-user-behaviour-birthday-challenge). Download the dataset for the challenge and explore it in Pandas. Write an article about any interesting insights you gain from exploring the data.
