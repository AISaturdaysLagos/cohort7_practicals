### Steps to submit the notebooks: ###

1. Open and set up git bash on your pc. See article for guidance [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14EqF_pICzzvl6BN0kROvUBnzUd21PRdj2y2TLBzEDDs/edit?usp=sharing)

2. Create a working directory (folder) on your local device

3. Open the folder on your terminal (git bash)

4. Initialize git on your local device with  `git init`

5. Clone your team's repository: `git clone https://github.com/AISaturdaysLagos/cohort7-team-x.git`

6. Open your new folder cloned from the github repo `cd cohort7-team-x`

7. Next open the folder for the assignment submission eg `cd "Data Science Notebook frameworks"`

8. On your file explorer, copy your downloaded notebook file (ipynb) and paste it into the submission folder

9. Return to your git bash, and type `git status` to view copied files yet to be staged

10. Stage the copied file for commit by using the `git add .` 

11. Then make a commit to your local repository `git commit -m "add your description"`

12. Add your remote repo: `git remote add origin https://github.com/AISaturdaysLagos/cohort7-team-x.git`

13. Then push to the repo: `git push origin main` (remember to use main and not master)

14. Check your team folder on github to confirm submission of assignment.

All the best!
