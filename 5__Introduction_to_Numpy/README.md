# `Introduction to Numpy`

## `Objective`

In this practical, we explore some of the methods Pandas makes available to analyze, explore and manipulate data.

## `Project Setup and Installation`
You can choose to run this notebook in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dhJ-t8VFtOEqYbw2xIXQWuqgWbkj4QQ5?usp=sharing). If you do so, be sure to `duplicate` the notebook so that you have a copy you can edit and run.

Alternatively, you can work in a virtual environment. If you already have a virtual environment created for a previous practical, you can simply activate the environment and install pandas using
```
pip install numpy>=1.20.2
```
Otherwise, create a new virtual environment then 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
